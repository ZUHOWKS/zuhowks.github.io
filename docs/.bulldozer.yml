# "version" is the configuration version, currently "1".
version: 1

# "merge" defines how and when pull requests are merged. If the section is
# missing, bulldozer will consider all pull requests and use default settings.
merge:
  # "whitelist" defines the set of pull requests considered by bulldozer. If
  # the section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests not excluded
  # by the blacklist.
  whitelist:
    # Pull requests targeting any of these branches are added to the whitelist.
    branches: ["development"]

  # "blacklist" defines the set of pull request ignored by bulldozer. If the
  # section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests. It takes the
  # same keys as the "whitelist" section.
  blacklist:
    labels: ["do not merge"]
    comment_substrings: ["==DO_NOT_MERGE=="]

  # "method" defines the merge method. The available options are "merge",
  # "rebase", and "squash".
  method: squash

  # Allows the merge method that is used when auto-merging a PR to be different based on the
  # target branch. The keys of the hash are the target branch name, and the values are the merge method that
  # will be used for PRs targeting that branch. The valid values are the same as for the "method" key.
  # Note: If the target branch does not match any of the specified keys, the "method" key is used instead.
  branch_method:
    development: squash

  # "options" defines additional options for the individual merge methods.
  options:
    # "squash" options are only used when the merge method is "squash"
    squash:
      # "title" defines how the title of the commit message is created when
      # generating a squash commit. The options are "pull_request_title",
      # "first_commit_title", and "github_default_title". The default is
      # "pull_request_title".
      title: "pull_request_title"

      # "body" defines how the body of the commit message is created when
      # generating a squash commit. The options are "pull_request_body",
      # "summarize_commits", and "empty_body". The default is "empty_body".
      body: "empty_body"

      # If "body" is "pull_request_body", then the commit message will be the
      # part of the pull request body surrounded by "message_delimiter"
      # strings. This is disabled (empty string) by default.
      message_delimiter: ==COMMIT_MSG==

  # "required_statuses" is a list of additional status contexts that must pass
  # before bulldozer can merge a pull request. This is useful if you want to
  # require extra testing for automated merges, but not for manual merges.

    - "policy-bot: development"

  # If true, bulldozer will delete branches after their pull requests merge.
